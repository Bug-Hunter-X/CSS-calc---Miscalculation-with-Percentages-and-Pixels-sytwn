The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly with percentages resulting in unexpected behavior. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not behave as expected in all browsers or contexts if the parent element's width is not explicitly set. The subtraction operation within `calc()` can lead to unexpected results, especially when percentages are combined with pixel values without a proper understanding of the context.
